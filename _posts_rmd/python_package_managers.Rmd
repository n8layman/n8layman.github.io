I'm a data scientist that works primarily in R. Recently I've been on a path to learn more about Python, which I initially installed via brew. Unfortunately I almost immediately ran into the following error:

```         
error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.

    If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
    create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
    Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
    sure you have python3-full installed.

    If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
    it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.

    See /usr/share/doc/python3.11/README.venv for more information.

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
```

Which led me down a rabbit hole of learning about virtual python environments. What started as a simple attempt to set up a new project and practice some python left me feel completely out to sea.

After days of wrestling with pip, poetry, conda, pipenv, and virtualenv, I was left scratching my head about Python's package management landscape. While choice is generally good, the sheer number of package managers in the Python ecosystem feels overwhelming, especially for newcomers. I can't help but wonder: what the hell happened?

Coming from R's relatively straightforward package management ecosystem with just {renv} handling most of my needs, I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of Python package management tools. Each seems to solve a different piece of the puzzle, and every blog post or tutorial I read seems to recommend a different approach. After spending weeks exploring various options and dealing with environment conflicts, I needed to make a choice that would work well for my data science workflow.

I mean just look at the table I made summarizing my notes!

And I'm certain I missed more than a few options.

After exploring these numerous options, I settled on [pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi) for my data science workflow, and here's why: As someone coming from R, I needed a tool that could handle both Python packages and the scientific computing dependencies that often come with data science work. What really sealed the deal was discovering that pixi can handle R packages, via conda-forge, alongside Python ones - which could be a game-changer for hybrid workflows where I might need both languages.

While conda is the traditional choice here, pixi offers a more modern and streamlined approach. Its `.toml` and `.lock` files ensure reproducibility (similar to renv in R), while its ability to handle non-Python dependencies means I don't have to worry about complex system-level installations or bother with docker for simple projects.

This is particularly valuable when working with packages that require specific system libraries or external dependencies like database drivers, CUDA toolkits, or specialized scientific computing libraries.

The `pixi.toml` configuration seems clean and intuitive and includes for templates and activation scripts. Most importantly, the task automation features let me define common data science workflows (like running jupyter notebooks or training models) in a way that's easily shareable with colleagues.

While it's true that pixi seems newer than some alternatives, its could help me resolving a lot of my package management needs simply and easiy. And its unique ability to handle both R and Python ecosystems made it the clear choice for my transition to a multi-language data science workflow. I expect there will still be some friction but I gotta admit, I'm excited. And I love the idea of being able to specify and install the versions of languages, my most used packages, and any external dependencies all from one place.\

I like the idea of being to open a shell and run something like:\
\`\`\`

```         
pixi add pytorch
```

or

```         
pixi add r-tidymodels
