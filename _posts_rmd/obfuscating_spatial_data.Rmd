First the awesome graphic from this post comes from this really interesting [project](https://www.redblobgames.com/x/1843-planet-generation/) to construct model planets by procedurally generating maps on a sphere. 

Okay now on to spatial obfuscation! There are a number of reasons why it might be important to obfuscate latitude and longitude data. Issues of privacy and security may make it a bad idea to reveal the precise location data was collected. I wanted to make a quick and dirty way to obfuscate latitutde and longitude data for a study while at the same time retaining the ability to share the raw data with collaborators.

The simplest way to do this is to take advantage of how random numbers are generated. As it turns out random numbers are not truly random. In fact it is quite hard to generate a truly random number. While there are some very creative [methods](https://blog.cloudflare.com/randomness-101-lavarand-in-production) to try and attain true randomness, in general, random numbers are generated using psuedo-random number generating (PRNG) algorithms that start with a seed and generate a series of numbers from that starting point. What this means is that high-quality PRNGs produce sequences of numbers that pass various statistical tests for randomness but they **don't** ensure randomness *between* sequences. What you get is a guarentee that the next number returned from subsequent calls to runif is random as long as you don't reset the algorithm or change the seed. 


In R we can generate numbers using the function `runif`.

``` {r}
runif(1)
```

If you want to ensure that you get the same number each time you can set the psuedo-random number seed before generating random number.
``` {r}
set.seed(10)
runif(1)
```

This will ensure that every time you run the code you will get the same result. But what about if someone else runs your code on another comptuer? As it turns out that unless you specify the specific PRNG, even when you set the same seed, it is possible to get a different result when using a different machine. To fix that we can specify which number we want to use as a seed _and_ what algorithm to use to convert that seed into a random number. This can be done like this:
``` {r}
set.seed(10, kind = "Mersenne-Twister", normal.kind = "Inversion")
runif(1)
```

Now if we use the same seed we can generate the same set of random numbers. This relates to spatial obfuscation because it gives us a method to generate random numbers using a secret key and then to undo the obfuscation operation for analysis or when sharing data with collaborators. This would look something like this.

``` {r}
obfuscate_latlong <- function(x, secret_seed, fuzz = 1, direction = 0) {

set.seed(secret_seed, kind = "Mersenne-Twister", normal.kind = "Inversion")
shift <- runif(length(x), min = -fuzz, max = fuzz)

x <- x + ifelse(!direction, -1, 1)*shift
x
} 

secret_seed <- 12345

x <- 48.8566
obfuscated <- obfuscate_latlong(x, secret_seed, direction = 0)
print(obfuscated)
unobfuscated <- obfuscate_latlong(obfuscated, secret_seed, direction = 1)

print(paste("Original value:", x))
print(paste("Obfuscated value:", obfuscated))
print(paste0("Unobfuscated value:", unobfuscated))
```

Now if you want to obfuscate latitude or longitude values in a reversable way all you have to do is share the secret_seed and the direction the data was originally encryped in! 

Obfuscation techniques might include aggregating data to larger geographic units, adding random noise as we did here, or using spatial masking methods. The goal is to balance data utility with the need to protect sensitive information. This can be challenging when we also want to ensure that analyses are open and reproducible. The gold standard of reproducibility is to share all code and data involved in an analsyis. With this, and similar methods, data can be publicly shared so that the method can be reproduced and the secret_seed shared with trusted collaborators to exactly reproduce the analysis results ensuring that the anonymnity of the data can be preserved.
